As a designer you'll most likely encounter user stories when working with or within agile development teams. In order to make sense of user stories, it's useful to have a basic idea of how agile development processes work overall.

## What's agile?

The goal of agile processes for software development is to ship useful features in an iterative way. There are variations on how this looks in practice in most companies, so for now we'll have to generalize a bit about what it may look like.

In most agile setups, small teams work in sprint cycles, most typically of two weeks. A sprint team may be around 4 to 8 people, often mostly developers. The team is responsible for organizing itself to get a certain amount of work done each sprint.

## Sprint planning

At the beginning of a sprint, teams look through the existing backlog of features, deciding on which features to try to tackle over the course of the sprint. Ideally, the team is able to estimate well what they will be able to accomplish during that sprint.
